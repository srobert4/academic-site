:wave: Hi! I'm a third year Ph.D. student in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at [U.C. Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Niloufar Salehi](http://niloufar.org) and [Dr. Moritz Hardt](https://mrtz.org/).  My research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction and machine learning. I'm especially excited about human-centered and participatory approaches to designing algorithmic systems that are transparent, reliable, and responsive to community values and needs. My current projects include engaging community members in the design of student assignment algorithms, developing more reliable and interactive machine translation systems, and analyzing data from a health tracking app to understand factors influencing adolescent menstrual health. In Fall 2021, I am a part-time Student Researcher at Google, where I work on the Ethical AI team, advised by [Dr. Mark DÃ­az](https://markjdiaz.com/). We are conducting a mixed method study to understand users' perspectives on machine translation quality in conversational settings.
