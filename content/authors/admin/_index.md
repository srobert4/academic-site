:wave: Hi! I'm a final year Ph.D. candidate in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at [U.C. Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Niloufar Salehi](http://niloufar.org). My research applies the theories and methods of human-computer interaction (HCI) to study machine learning and data systems. I'm currently thinking about how we can build trustworthy and verifiable systems by aligning modeling assumptions with real world needs and goals, and prioritizing user agency. My current projects include developing more reliable machine translation systems for high-stakes domains like healthcare ([here's a recent talk](https://youtu.be/uHL6uf_2KO0)), and exploring what participant engagement might look like in the context of large-scale menstrual health research.

At Berkeley, I'm a member of [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), the [Berkeley HCI Group](https://hci.berkeley.edu/) and the [EPIC Data Lab](https://epic.berkeley.edu/). During my Ph.D. I have interned with the Machine Learning Visualization team at Apple, with [Dr. Fred Hohman](https://fredhohman.com/) and [Dr. Mary Beth Kery](https://marybethkery.com/), and the (former) Ethical AI team at Google, with [Dr. Mark DÃ­az](https://markjdiaz.com/).

**I am currently looking for full-time roles in research, data science, and software engineering.** If you are looking for a mixed-methods data scientist who loves to prototype new systems and always has end-users' real world needs and contexts front of mind, [I would love to hear from you](/#contact)!
