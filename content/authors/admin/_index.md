:wave: Hi! I recently graduated with my Ph.D. in [EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at [U.C. Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Niloufar Salehi](http://niloufar.org). In January 2024 I'll be joining [Abridge](http://abridge.ai/) as a Machine Learning Engineer.

My research applies the theories and methods of human-computer interaction (HCI) to study machine learning and data systems. I'm interested in building reliable algorithmic systems by helping people set their expectations of systems' capabilities, and giving them mechanisms for recovery when a system fails. My main research projects during grad school focused on machine translation in high-stakes domains like healthcare, matching algorithms for student assignment, and participant engagement in large-scale menstrual health research.
